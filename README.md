🧠 Radiology Imaging Assistant – AI-Powered Diagnostic Tool
This project combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) to support radiologists in diagnosing ultrasound, chest X-ray, and COVID-19 cases efficiently.

🚀 Key Features
Ultrasound Imaging Analysis – Automated interpretation using deep learning.

Chest X-ray Classification – Detects common thoracic conditions with high accuracy.

COVID-19 Detection – Identifies infection patterns in chest X-rays.

Interactive GUI – Enables easy image upload, analysis, and result visualization for medical professionals.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python

CNN (TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch)

GUI (Tkinter / PyQt)

OpenCV & PIL for image preprocessing

Matplotlib for visualization

📌 Objectives
Improve diagnostic accuracy in radiology using AI.

Offer a simple, intuitive interface for clinical use.

Demonstrate the real-world impact of machine learning in healthcare.
